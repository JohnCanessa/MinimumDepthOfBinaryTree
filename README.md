LeetCode 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree in Java
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/

In this problem we are asked to write a function that will
return the minimum depth of a binary tree. This seems to be 
the complement of getting the maximum depth of a binary tree
problem also found in LeetCode.

If interested in my comments I invite you to read the following
